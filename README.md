* Touch your finger to the screen to draw a line
* Change that line's size, hue, brightness, saturation, and opacity through a settings screen
* Preview above settings changes to see what your line style will be
* Draw many lines with many different line styles
* Undo and redo drawn lines
* Clear your drawing screen

The app is most easily run through a working copy of Android Studio using a physical phone or an emulator.

# Sources

No complete code or full open source libraries were specifically taken to create this project, though many websites were visited for research and to learn how to program in Android Studio (primarily Jon Froehlich's resources, Android Studio documentation pages, and many Stack Overflow pages).
